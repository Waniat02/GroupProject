# Project Title:

Parking Lot Management System


# Project Description

This project is a Java application that simulates a Parking Lot Management System. It will provide basic functionality for tracking vehicles as they enter and exit a parking lot. The system makes sure that the lot does not exceed its capacity, calculates parking fees based on the time each vehicle spends in the lot, and displays the current status of parked vehicles.
The application will use various Java features such as:
- Classes and Objects for modeling the parking lot and vehicles.
- java.time API to accurately compute the duration of parking.
- Conditional logic to handle full capacity and vehicle exit scenarios.

Users will be able to:
- Add (enter) vehicles with a license plate.
- Remove (exit) vehicles and see the fee owed.
- View how many vehicles are currently parked.
